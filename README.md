The corresponding Python file for the data preprocessing section is data_process.py, the corresponding Python file for building the network structure is model.py, the corresponding Python file for training the model is train.py, and the corresponding Python file for testing the model is test.py. After installing the required third-party libraries (torch, pickle, numpy, matplotlib, time), place the yelp_academic_dataset_review.json file in the ../dataset/ path. Run the code files in order: data_process.py → train.py → test.py.
